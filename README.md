# The Playlist - Tech Test

## Specification:
#### Print a list of songs for the DJ, filtered by year.
Introduction
You have just been hired by the producer of a new radio show.
You have been given the following catalogue of music:

 The DJ is starting in an hour, and she needs to view a list of songs for a given year, in a browser.
#### Requirements
Each song in the list should contain the following information:  
• Title  
• Artist  
• Album  
• Year  

As time is tight, the aim is to deliver the minimum viable product which un-blocks the DJ to play the songs.
Assume that you can give the DJ simple instructions on how to use the UI. You can use google or the interviewer for information as needed.

#### My Approach
I chose to do this in Java, as Capital One use Java in their stack and I have used it before and wanted the chance to practise.

#### To run the code

Open up Terminal (Mac), clone the repository and change into the directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/AttyC/capital-one-tech-test
cd capital-one-tech-test
```
Open your IDE and import the project (I used Eclipse).  

#### To run the Project:   
1. Right-click the Playlist.java file in Package Explorer.  
2. Click the Run button.


#### To run the tests:

1. Right-click the PlaylistTest.java file in Package Explorer
2. Click the Run button.

#### If I had more time, I would:

1. Write more tests
2. Fix errors running in command line
3. Read in the song list array from external source (e.g. text file / database)
4. Allow filter by other criteria
5. Add a user interface
6. Explore Java some more.
